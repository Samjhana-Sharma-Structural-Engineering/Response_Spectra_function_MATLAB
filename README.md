# Response_Spectra_function_MATLAB
Description:
•	The Repository contains:
o	Main_code.m:  It analyzes earthquake ground motion data obtained from the EI Centro dataset. It computes and plots the response spectrum for spectral displacement, velocity and acceleration for different damping ratios.
o	Function_code.m:  It computes the response (displacement and velocity) of a structure subjected to earthquake ground motion using the Newmark-beta method.

The Newmark-beta method is a numerical integration technique commonly used in structural dynamics to solve the equations of motion for dynamic systems subjected to external loads. It is an implicit method that provides accurate solutions for both linear and nonlinear structural systems.
•	The Data folder contains the acceleration records of Elcentro earthquake.
•	The Figure folder contains the output of MATLAB codes.

Example:
Following three figures below are obtained by running the MATLAB code. The code read the data in the Data folder and computes the acceleration, velocity and displacement response spectra for different value of damping ratio
